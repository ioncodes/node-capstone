# node-capstone

`node-capstone` provides Node.js bindings for the
[Capstone](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone) disassembler library, allowing
binary data in `Buffer` objects to be disassembled using any of Capstone's
supported architectures.

### Dependencies

* [node.js v0.12.x](https://nodejs.org/)
    * [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/)
* [Capstone](http://www.capstone-engine.org/)


### Install

`npm install capstone`

#### libcapstone

The Capstone library is not included, and must be installed separately. The
recommended method to install on OSX is using homebrew:

`brew install capstone`

On Windows and Linux, install a pre-compiled binary from the
[Capstone download](http://www.capstone-engine.org/download.html) page, or
build from source.

Ensure `libcapstone` or `capstone` is available in your PATH. Additionally, the `libcapstone` or `capstone`
version needs to match the binding's version.

### Basic usage

```javascript
var capstone = require("capstone");
var code = new Buffer([ 0x55, 0x48, 0x8b, 0x05, 0xb8, 0x13, 0x00, 0x00 ]);

var cs = new capstone.Cs(capstone.ARCH_X86, capstone.MODE_64);

cs.detail = true;
cs.disasm(code, 0x1000).forEach(function (insn) {
    console.log(
        "0x%s:\t%s\t%s\t%s",
        insn.address.toString(16), insn.mnemonic, insn.op_str,
        JSON.stringify(insn.detail)
    );
});

cs.close();
```

For other examples, see the tests in the `spec` directory.
